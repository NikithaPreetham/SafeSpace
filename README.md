# Safe Space (Therapeutic Chatbot)

A basic chatbot targeting users who are prone to anxiety, panic attacks, and depression on our
teamâ€™s personal domain (http://yoursafespace.net/ - domain name now unpaid for) which links to Spotify to retrieve playlists according to the
mood, play it on a Bose SoundTouch speaker, and deploy it using Google Cloud. 

Created as part of HackHer413's 2019 hackathon projects.
